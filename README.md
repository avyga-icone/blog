## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── i18n/
│   ├── sanity/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.


Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
